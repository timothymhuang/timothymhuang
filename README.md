# About Timothy
Hello. My name is Timothy and I like coding random projects. I am currently in high school in 10th grade (as of 2021).

# What this repostiory is
Welcome to my main GitHub repository. This is where I put any random stuff I'm doing that I want to share. It is only going to include small projects that I felt like doing at the time.
